			I am so thrilled to be traveling to Copenhagen, as it is one of my favorite places in the world. I had the privilege of spending a day in the city a few years ago, on the tail end of a business trip. I was amazed that every block I walked was incredibly beautiful, and I was amazed how the streetscapes could immediately elevate my mood. I am excited to return and spend a much more extended period of time learning about how this city was designed, and about how transportation and interconnectivity is central to that feeling.
		</p>
		<p class="blog_text">
            Around the world, I have seen few places like Copenhagen which provide such a mix of transportation alternatives to the individual motor vehicle. I live in Cincinnati, Ohio, which has a single streetcar line, a relatively robust bus system, and about 20 miles of multi-use paths. That’s it. Because of this, and also the lack of intercity transit options, I have joined the organization All Aboard Ohio. Over the past two years, I have risen the ranks and now lead the group. In this position, I have the opportunity to interface with elected and appointed leaders in cities across the state, and am so excited to bring examples I see here to them.
		</p>

            Cincinnati is a weird place. Think “Portland” weird, but with less nature and more conservative. We have weird food, quirky festivals, and a remarkably strong arts scene. Any of us from Cincy will say that it is incredibly underrated, and a great place to live.
		</p>
		<p class="blog_text">
            But another thing anybody from Cincinnati will say is “it has a long way to go”. And any progress which has been made has required a long, hard fight. Many other projects have made progress, and then have stalled in their tracks (sometimes literally - our Subway tunnels are complete, but have sat vacant for over a century). Our recent zoning updates passed council after threats, protests and tears in city hall. 
		</p>
		<p class="blog_text">
            Mark Twain once said, “When the world ends, I want to be in Cincinnati because it is always 20 years behind the times”. It has been this way for centuries.
		</p>
		<p class="blog_text">
            But the tide is turning, new organizations are popping up around our city, advocating for improved public transportation, pedestrian safety and cycling infrastructure. Millions of dollars have been raised to “crown the Queen City”, a plan to connect many neighborhoods with dedicated bike infrastructure. Ohio is studying intercity rail between Cincinnati, Columbus and Cleveland. The time has come for transit in Cincinnati, and I hope to be involved in making sure it is done right - ideally with Copenhagen as a model.
